* RoboCup Images Usage Guide

This document will help you get started using the RoboCup Software Virtualbox Image

1. Install VirtualBox

   Install VirtualBox from the [[https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads][VirtualBox downloads page]].

2. Ensure you have Virtualization turned on in your BIOS

   [[http://www.howtogeek.com/213795/how-to-enable-intel-vt-x-in-your-computers-bios-or-uefi-firmware/][This]] is a simple guide of how to do this.
   While this is not 100% necessary, it will make your VM much faster.

   On a Windows host, you may need to turn off Hyper-V as well.

3. Get a Copy of the built Image

   First start by downloading the prebuilt image (a link should have been distributed to you) or by manually building the image.
   See [[file:README.org::*Building][the README]] for more information about building this project.

4. Extract Image

   If you have downloaded the image from a distributed link, simply extract the zip file, which will produce several result files.

   If you have manually extracted the image, go to =box/virtualbox= and extract the =.box= file there.
   It can be extracted via tar, ex: ~tar -xvf ubuntu1604-desktop-nocm-0.1.0.box~.

5. Import Image into VBox

   1. Go to =File->Import Appliance=

   2. Select the =.box= file you extracted earlier

   3. Increase the Amount of Memory and CPU's

      Increase the Memory/CPU to your computer's specs. Don't allocate too much memory/cpus!

   4. Hit =Import=!

6. Configure Settings of Imported Image

   1. Right click your new virtualbox entry, and hit =settings=

   2. Increase the Amount of Video RAM, and turn on 3D Acceleration

      If you do not have virtualization, virtualbox may not allow you to turn on 3D Acceleration

   3. Turn *OFF* =Remote Display=

7. Boot your new VM

   Double Click the Entry, or Right Click -> Start -> Normal Start

8. Credentials

   |---------+----------|
   | User    | Password |
   |---------+----------|
   | vagrant | vagrant  |
   |---------+----------|

   The sudo password is =vagrant=.

9. Testing

   To test out your new RoboCup VM, open a terminal (use the search in the top left), and type these two commands

   #+BEGIN_SRC shell
     cd ~/robocup-software
     make run-sim
   #+END_SRC

10. You Made It! :tada:

    Have a great time contributing to the largest and most prestigious undergraduate, student-run, autonomous soccer codebase at Georgia Tech.
